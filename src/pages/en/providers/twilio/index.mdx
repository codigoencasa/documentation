## Send Buttons
One of the most requested functions by users is the fact of __sending buttons__ to generate more interactivity and more dynamic chatbots.

```ts {{title:'app.ts'}}
const welcomeFlow = addKeyword<Provider, Database>(['template','plantilla'])
    .addAction(async (ctx) => {
       await provider.send(ctx.from,
        'Agregar dos botones que permiten al cliente dar una respuesta mas rapida',
            {
                contentSid: 'HXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
            }
        )
    })
```


<Note>
Remember that the use of buttons, lists and other featured Whatsapp functionality needs to be a template authorized by the provider.
`contentSid` is the id of the approved template you can use.
