# BuilderBot Brand Guidelines and Assets

Avoid representing the BuilderBot brand in a way that:

- Implies partnership, sponsorship or endorsement.
- Makes the BuilderBot brand the most distinctive or prominent feature.
- Puts the BuilderBot brand in a negative context as part of a script or storyline. You must comply with our Terms of Use and Community Guidelines.

### Keep the word BuilderBot consistent

Avoid representing the BuilderBot brand in a way that:

- Keep the letters "B" in BuilderBot capitalized and in the same font size and style as the content surrounding it.
- If you offer an app, website or a product or service that uses the BuilderBot APIs or is otherwise compatible with or related to BuilderBot, you may only use BuilderBot to say that your app is "for BuilderBot" or that the name of your campaign is "on BuilderBot" in a descriptive manner.
- Don't modify, abbreviate or translate the word BuilderBot to a different language or by using non-English characters, or use any of our logos to replace it.
- Don't combine "Builder" or "Bot" with your own brand.
- Don't combine any part of the BuilderBot brand with a company name, other trademarks, or generic terms.

### Distance BuilderBot from other platforms

- BuilderBot may be mentioned in a television commercial with its parent company or other affiliated companies.
- Don't mention other similar platforms in the same spot as BuilderBot, unless it's a general "Find us on..." call to action.
- If you create a hashtag that uses the word Builder or Bot, it shouldn't be used on other platforms and you shouldn't try to acquire or enforce rights over that hashtag.
